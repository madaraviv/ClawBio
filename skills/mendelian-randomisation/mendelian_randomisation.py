    problem: with a relative spread around 1e-10 the shipped code raised on roughly a
    third of well-sized inputs at n = 5 and n = 10.

    Hartwig FP, Davey Smith G, Bowden J 2017, Int J Epidemiol 46(6):1985-1998
    (doi:10.1093/ije/dyx102; PMID 29040600), which specifies both a bandwidth
    proportional to the spread of the ratios and a bootstrapped standard error.

    This follows the paper's weighted MBE and its reference implementation
    (TwoSampleMR `mr_weighted_mode`, Hemani et al. 2018) term by term:

    - ratio SEs by the delta method, `sqrt(sy^2/bx^2 + by^2*sx^2/bx^4)` (the
      "not assuming NOME" column the reference uses for the weighted mode);
    - standardised inverse-variance weights, eq. 5: `w_j = se_j^-2 / sum(se^-2)`;
    - bandwidth `h = phi * s` with the modified Silverman rule, eq. 7:
      `s = 0.9 * min(sd, 1.4826*mad) / L^(1/5)`, and the reference's `phi = 1`;
    - standard error = 1.4826 x the median absolute deviation of a parametric
      bootstrap of the ratios (each ratio redrawn from N(ratio, se_ratio)), the
      bandwidth recomputed on every draw;
    - p-value from a t distribution on L - 1 degrees of freedom, as the reference does.

    Why this replaces what was here. THE BANDWIDTH WAS AN ABSOLUTE 0.5 whatever the data
    looked like. On instruments whose ratios have a standard deviation of 0.28 -- an
    ordinary MR scale -- 0.5 is nearly twice the entire spread, so the kernels merge into
    one blob and the "mode" slides onto the weighted mean: measured 0.5469 against an
    IVW estimate of 0.5281, while the same data at a bandwidth of 0.1 gives 0.6679. An
    estimator whose whole purpose is to disagree with the mean when most instruments
    agree with each other cannot have a smoothing width that swamps the disagreement.
    A data-scaled bandwidth also makes the estimator invariant to the units of the data,
    as the mean and the median already were.

    THE STANDARD ERROR IS A BOOTSTRAP. The previous `2 / sum(|bx_i|/sy_i)` is a function
    of the instrument count and the outcome standard errors and NOTHING ELSE -- it does
    not look at the dispersion of the ratios whose mode it is reporting. Measured over
    ratio standard deviations from 0.0000 to 0.8265, an 800-fold change in how spread
    out the estimates are, the reported SE did not move at all: 0.02079 at n=10 and
    0.00429 at n=40 in every case. It was most confident exactly where the point
    estimate was least stable -- at the widest dispersion the mode itself moved from
    0.9673 to 0.3958 between two samples whose SEs were 0.0208 and 0.0043.

    The bootstrap redraws each ratio from its own reported uncertainty and re-derives
    the mode, so the SE reflects how much the mode actually moves.

    The weights were also `1/se`; the paper's eq. 5 and the reference implementation use
    `1/se^2`. Corrected here, since the function now claims to be that estimator.

    Compares how much variance the instruments explain in the exposure against how much
    they explain in the outcome; more in the exposure supports exposure -> outcome.

    THE VARIANCE EXPLAINED IS COMPUTED FROM THE Z-STATISTIC, WHICH IS UNIT-FREE.
    The previous form, `r2 = 2*eaf*(1-eaf)*beta^2`, is a variance explained only if the
    trait happens to have variance 1: there is no division by the trait's variance and
    no sample size anywhere in it. So the verdict moved when the outcome was expressed
    in different units, which is not a scientific property of anything. Measured on ten
    instruments with a true ratio of 0.5, rescaling the outcome alone -- mmol/L to
    mg/dL, say -- flipped `correct` from True to False between factors of 1 and 3, with
    p astronomically small on BOTH sides, so it reported near-certainty in opposite
    directions depending on a unit choice.

    `r2 = z^2 / (z^2 + n - 2)` is the conversion for a continuous trait (the F statistic
    of a one-predictor regression on n - 2 residual degrees of freedom; TwoSampleMR
    `get_r_from_bsen`), and z is invariant to the units of beta because the standard
    error carries the same units.

    Sample sizes are OPTIONAL, and what is reported depends on what is available:

    - both present: a variance explained per side, and a p-value from the Fisher
      z-transform difference of two INDEPENDENT correlations -- which is what two-sample
      MR has by construction, the exposure and outcome coming from different studies.
      (The paper states the one-sample form, Steiger's Z for correlated correlations
      within one population; its two-sample implementation, TwoSampleMR `mr_steiger`,
      uses the independent-samples test, and so does this.)
    - absent: with equal sample sizes the comparison reduces to |z_exposure| >
      |z_outcome|, so the DIRECTION is still well defined and still unit-free. The
      p-value is not: it is returned as None with the assumption stated in `note`,
      rather than as a number from the previous `sqrt(r2_exp + r2_out) * 0.01`, whose
      0.01 has no derivation.
