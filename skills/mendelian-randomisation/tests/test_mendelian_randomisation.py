# MR-Egger applicability: two independent conditions, and a trap in the obvious
# test suite for them
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# MR-Egger fits a slope AND an intercept. Two things have to hold, and neither implies
# the other:
#
#   STATISTICAL  n >= 3, or there is no residual degree of freedom at all.
#   NUMERICAL    at least two distinct beta_exposure values, which is not an n < 3
#                problem -- it is reachable at any n from a merge that duplicates one
#                SNP across rows, tissues or proxies.
#
# THE TRAP, and why the cases below are shaped the way they are: the n < 3 return comes
# FIRST, so every n=1 and n=2 input short-circuits before it ever reaches the
# conditioning test. A suite made only of n=1 and n=2 cases therefore passes whether or
# not the centered denominator and the relative threshold work at all -- which is the
# "a gate never observed failing is not known to work" failure, committed by the very
# tests written to prevent it. The n>=3 near-collinear case is the only input that
# reaches the second guard, so it is the load-bearing one here.
